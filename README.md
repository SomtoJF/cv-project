# CV GENERATOR

CV Generator webapp craeted with ReactJS.
Fill in your information and get an ATS compliant resume instantly.

### Note:

For the best results use this app on a larger screen prefarably a laptop or desktop. The app is completely responsive but issues might arise when trying to get the resume in `.pdf` format. This is because the pdf converter doesnt get the letters off the HTML CV, but rather converts the HTML CV to pdf as it is on the screen. This may result in the actual CV taking up a small amount of space on the paper due to difference in the sizes of your screen and a letter sized (A4) paper which the pdf converter attempts to transfer the CV information to.
